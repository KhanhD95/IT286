Game:  The Last Hope is a survival battle royal game where players gets drop off by an air plane onto an island and they have to battle 50 other players and try to be last one standing to win the game. Not only does the player have to battle other players they will face monsters and zombies as well on this island. The objective is to gather as much resources and weapons as soon as possible and get ready to survive to be the last one standing.

Level: Since the whole game will take place on an island there are many abandoned towns that players will be playing in. For this assignment I will focus on the level design of a house inside an abandoned town. The house setting will be covered in plant lives, and the inside is old and rusted and broken down. In the houses players can find weapons and resources.

User Persona: Any gamers that enjoys playing any type of battle royal games similarly to FortNite and PUBG will enjoy this game for sure and also others who also enjoys the survival aspects like the Last of Us, Tomb Raiders or Metro where players would have to scavenge for things to simply survive.
